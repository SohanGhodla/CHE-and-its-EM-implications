Data required to reproduce most of the figures in the article arXiv:2208.03999

Notebook named **Figure_1_2_3_4_5.ipynb** recreated Fig. 1,2,3,4,5 and **Figure_9_10_11_12_C1_C2.ipynb** plots Fig 9,10,11,12,C1,C2.
Some figures require additional input that has been precalculated and stored in the files named "B_phi_data.txt", "Collapsar_calc_data.txt"
and "Run_dat_NS_period.txt". The contents of these files are:

1) **B_phi_data.txt** - contains the toroidal component of the proto NS's magnetic field along the the precollapse masses of the progenitor star.
2) **Collapsar_calc_data.txt** - contains the precollapse mass of the progenitor star along with the isotropic equivalent energy and energy emitted in the winds.
3) **Run_dat_NS_period.txt** - contains the precollapse mass of the progenitor star along with the rotational period and rotational energy of the proto NS.

The **Pics** folder stores the output figures from the notebooks. 
The "MESA_stars_with_variable_Dutch_scaling" contain the MESA inslist required to reproduce the MESA models used in section 5.3, 5.4 of the article.

The **Data_fig_1** folder contains data for generating Fig. 1.
The **Efficient_AM_mixing** folder contains data and MESA  inlist required to reporduce Fig. 3
